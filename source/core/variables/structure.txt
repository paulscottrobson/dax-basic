Variables structure
===================

Only supports single dimension arrays.

2 x HashTableSize arrays of 4 byte address records (2 for Z80,3 for eZ80)
	- 1 for integers
	- 1 for arrays

Each points to a linked list terminating in $0 - the hash table address itself may be $0

Each record is as follows:

	0 		Hash of variable name (not including array parenthesis)
	1..4 	Pointer to next record in variable chain, or 0.
	5..8 	Address of identifier in BASIC code.

	9..12 	Value of variable 		9..12 	Maximum array element ID (e.g. DIM x(8) this is 8)
									13..16 	Element #0 (for DIM x(8) there are 9 in total, 0..8)
